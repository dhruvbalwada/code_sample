I have been coding for almost 15 now and I have transitioned over a number of languages in this duration, based on the requirement. Within the last few years I have worked mostly with MATLAB and FORTRAN, but also to a limited extent with Python. I would not say that the choice of any of these languages was necessarily for some special technical reasons, but primarily as it was what helped me work best with the research group that I was working with. 

Most of the DIMES data processing and analysis was done using MATLAB. A software program called ARTOA (http://www.whoi.edu/instrument/rafos/artoa-float-tracking), developed at WHOI, was used for the float processing. During the few years that I worked with ARTOA I was an active developer for the software and helped fix bugs and added some small modules to it. 

I have also used MATLAB for other purposes. Currently I plot most of my figures in MATLAB and then tweak them in Inkscape to make them publication quality. 

I started using FORTRAN as an undergraduate. At that time I was working with a simple shallow water model that has been developed using FMS (http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms). One of the tasks I was required to do was to change the numerical scheme (enstrophy conserving scheme to energy conserving), which required me to learn how to code solvers that work on parallel processors. I used TotalView for debugging the parallelized code and the simulations were run on a super computer at CMMACS (http://www.cmmacs.ernet.in/). 

At FSU my experience with FORTRAN has been primarily for course work. A one semseter course on Numerical ocean modeling required me to tinker with a reduced gravity model. However, a wealth of experience was gained during a 1 year course series on Numerical PDEs. During this time I worked on a lot of finite difference and finite volume solvers that required me to write modular code and use advanced data structures. The codes can be found here (https://github.com/dhruvbalwada/Numerical_PDEs). The codes under the FVM folder are in my opinion the most sophisticated.
